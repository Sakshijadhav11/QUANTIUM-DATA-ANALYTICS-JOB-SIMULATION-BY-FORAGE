# QUANTIUM-DATA-ANALYTICS

# Quantium Virtual Internship – Task 1: Retail Strategy & Analytics

In this project, we analyze transaction and customer data for a chips category review. The goal is to understand purchasing behavior across customer segments and provide a strategic recommendation to Julia, the Category Manager.
## Data Cleaning Summary

- Converted `DATE` from integer to datetime
- Removed non-chip products (e.g., salsa)
- Removed an outlier customer who bought 200 packets in one transaction
- Extracted 'PACK_SIZE' and 'BRAND' from product names
## Data Analysis

- Total sales by customer segment (LIFESTAGE + PREMIUM status)
- Average units per customer
- Average price per unit
## Recommendation to Julia – Chip Strategy

### Target Segment:
**Mainstream Young Singles/Couples**

### Key Findings:
- Highest total spend on chips
- Pays highest average price per packet
- Prefers large pack sizes (175g, 150g, 134g)
- Top brands: Kettle, Pringles, Doritos

### Recommendation:
Focus promotions and product placement on large packs of premium brands like Kettle and Doritos for this segment. Use lifestyle-driven marketing to appeal to their preferences.
